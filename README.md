Repository containing my final project for Dicoding's "Intro to ML" course. It is an image classifier that classifies pictures of hands signing "rock", "paper", and "scissors". 

The classifier is implemented using Tensorflow's Keras interface.

The project is made with Google Colab, with the filename **DicodingAssignment.ipynb**
